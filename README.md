**Project Name:**  Portfolio Website

**Description:**

CodTech is a responsive, single-page portfolio website designed to showcase a developer's projects, skills, and personal brand. This portfolio is built using HTML and CSS, featuring a clean, minimalist design focused on clarity and ease of navigation. The website is fully responsive, meaning it adapts seamlessly to a variety of screen sizes—from mobile devices to desktops—ensuring a smooth user experience on any device.

**Purpose:**

The purpose of this project is to provide an easy-to-use and visually appealing template for developers to showcase their skills, experiences, and projects to potential employers or clients. With the rapidly growing need for developers to have an online presence, CodTech offers a straightforward way to display one’s work. It serves as a personal branding tool that reflects the developer’s expertise, attention to detail, and professional development.

**Features:**

1. **Responsive Design:** CodTech automatically adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a flawless experience on mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops.
   
2. **Header Section:** The header includes a navigation bar with links to sections like "About Me," "Skills," "Projects," and "Contact." The navigation bar is designed to be sticky, allowing users to easily move to any section without scrolling through the entire page.

3. **Hero Section:** At the top of the page, a large hero section displays a brief introduction of the developer, including their name, role, and a catchy tagline. This section is visually engaging and introduces the website visitor to the developer's personality.

4. **About Me Section:** This section highlights the developer's background, skills, and work philosophy. It provides insight into the developer’s journey and gives potential clients or employers a better understanding of who they are and what they do.

5. **Contact Section:** This section includes a contact form that allows potential employers or clients to reach out to the developer. The form collects essential information like name, email, message, and a submit button for easy communication. Additionally, the section may contain social media links to platforms like LinkedIn, GitHub, or Twitter.

6. **Footer Section:** The footer is a place to include additional information such as copyright notices, social media links, and a personal tagline.

**Technologies Used:**

- **HTML:** The foundation of the website is built with HTML. It structures the content and defines all the sections within the portfolio.
  
- **CSS:** CSS is used for styling the website. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness of the site. The CSS ensures that the site is visually appealing and adapts to different screen sizes.

- **Media Queries:** CSS media queries are used to ensure that the portfolio looks great on all screen sizes. These queries adjust the layout depending on the device, making the website mobile-friendly.

- **Flexbox/Grid Layout:** These CSS techniques are used to create a clean and organized design. Flexbox and grid layouts allow for responsive and dynamic positioning of elements, ensuring that content looks good on both large and small screens.
